Race Timer
==========

Race Timer is for timing ski (and possibly other) races.  Two Rasberry Pi computers are used wirelessly at the start
gate and the finish gate.  This code is for the timer server, most likely located at the finish line.

Work of both software and hardware is still in progress.
